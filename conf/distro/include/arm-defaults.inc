# This function changes the default tune for machines which
# are based on armv7a to use common tune value, note that we enforce hard-float
# which is default on Ångström for armv7+
# so if you have one of those machines which are armv7a but can't support
# hard-float, please change tune = 'armv7athf' to tune = 'armv7at'
# below but then this is for your own distro, Ångström will not support
# it
